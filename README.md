# credit-card-checker-codecademy
Project from Codecademy, utilizes Luhn's Algorithm

The project goal was guided by Codecademy, but not the code itself. The purpose of this program is threefold:

First, we need to verify if a card number is valid or not utilizing Lunh's Algorithm.
Second, we need to identify all invalid card numbers at once.
Finally, we need to identify the card companies which may have issued invalid numbers (which is determined based on the first digit of the card number).
